# BusReservationSystem

PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

    Hey ! What’s up my ! My Name’s Narayan, I am really found myself proud to present this project .

  -->   Through this project I aimed to develop a reservation system  especially for the travelling buses on road through which we can book the  ticket for a particular traveller.
  
  -->   Also they can check the status of their seats .You can explore many more features while exploring this project.

  -->   For the owner point of view, he will get the file named  “Reservation.txt” in his local computer which contains all the data for  particular bus no. All the data is saved         in the file named according to the bus no.

  -->   I have used various concepts of data structures like file handling , efficient  array utilization ,etc. 


  -->   Also for future work we can also make some advancement in this project and can be applied and used for different modules sytems.


I experienced myself very bold, happy and innovative while working on this project.
I think and hope , All the users would like this system ! shouldn’t it ?


Thanks and Regards !
