# BusReservationSystem

>## PROJECT DESCRIPTION :

    Hey ! What’s up ! My Name’s Narayan, I am really found myself proud to present this project .

  **-->**  Through this project I aimed to develop a reservation system  especially for the travelling buses on road through which we can book the  ticket for a particular traveller.
  
  **-->**   Also they can check the status of their seats .You can explore many more features while exploring this project.

  **-->**   For the owner point of view, he will get the file named  **“Reservation.txt**” in his local computer which contains all the data for  particular bus no. All the data is saved   in the file named according to the bus no.

  **-->**   I have used various concepts of data structures like **file handling , efficient  array utilization**, etc. 


  **-->**  Also for future work we can also make some advancement in this project and can be applied and used for different modules sytems.


I experienced myself very bold, happy and innovative while working on this project.
I think and hope , All the users would like this system ! shouldn’t it ?


>Thanks and Regards !
  
  **Narayan**
